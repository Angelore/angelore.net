### Intro
[The Surge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Surge_%28video_game%29) is an action RPG that came out in May, 2017. It is considered by many to be a "side-grade" to Dark Souls series, with the main comparison, of course, being Dark Souls 3. I will also make some comparisons to DS3 here. Firstly, I will need a reference point for some of the things in this review, and also for the simple fact that I got The Surge only because I craved for a sci-fi Dark Souls. Oh well.  
Also some points that I would like to get out of the way quickly:
- There will be mild spoilers
- The game is more than a year old at this point. I have played it only recently
- I am not a diehard Souls fan. I have not played the majority of the games in the series (as a matter of fact, I have only played DS3, the rest I have experienced mostly through watching speedruns)
- I do consider myself a decent player (I've beaten Midir and only ragequit once :V)
- This review was written at 19th of February, 2018, and was collecting dust on my drive (yep). I decided that it deserves better

### A brave new world
The Surge is Deck13's second attempt at a so called souls-like game. The first one, Lords of the Fallen, didn't turn out very good, which became an issue for the successor PR-wise. The discussions of the game mostly stopped dead in the tracks when anybody brought up LotF. If you think about it though, it's a bit counter-intuitive, since people tend to learn from their mistakes. And also there is the fact that nobody would risk publishing this game if it at least didn't look *somehow* promising. But when did logic stop anyone anyway?  
Well, long story short, The Surge came out and got moderately good scores, but alas, not too much sales (although it turned out that this was enough, since the sequel got scheduled for 2019).  
In this review I will try to analyse what The Surge did right and where it has missed the mark. And so, without further ado...

##### The setting and world building
The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world of the near future, which is not exactly a unique or breathtaking premise, but an intriguing one nonetheless. A desolated world where almost everything is hostile to you, where you are trying to piece together what exactly has happened is the kind of setting that will appeal to the target audience of the game, e.g. hardcore gamers. The same approach is used by Dark Souls to great success. However, the game I was constantly reminded of while playing was BioShock. Despite not being under the ocean, there was still a lot of parallels, and the overall tone of both games seemed very similar (well, if we throw away the political commentary of BioShock). Your enemies are not some abstract lovecraftian monsters, but the workers of the complex, you get most of information about the world not from the NPCs, but from the audiologs, the overall tragedy is rooted in the vices of humans, and so on.  
Speaking of the **audiologs**, while I think that this particular approach is great, the implementation could be better. You can't "read" the audiologs, since only the very beginning of them is transcribed in the inventory screen. You can't listen to them in the inventory either - when you start playback, you are thrown back into the game for some reason (and you have to scroll through the menu to find the place where you were later). Also, the logs can be sorted either by the name or by the obtaining date, which not really useful. Even for the logs that are numbered, the sorting doesn't work, since the logs will be sorted like this: #11, #13, #2, #22, #8. Of course, for the logs that are not numbered (the majority of them) it works even worse, since they will be ordered by the first letter in their title.  
There is another narration feature in the game, and that one is very familiar to the souls' fans - **item descriptions**. Alas, it's not very well utilised here, since the descriptions are mostly basic and are not really contributing towards the lore. Most of them can be summarized as "This is a weapon, it was built for *this* purpose." or "This was not a weapon, but now it is.". The same goes for armor. Quest items mostly have succinct functional descriptions, but there is not much of quest items in the game anyway.  
**Quests** are very barebones and similar to DS in the way they are presented to you. In other words, it's pretty easy to miss them and there is not much information on what are you supposed to do. Moreover, there are very few of them in the game, and most of them will end in the death of an NPC, which is unfortunate, but very souls-like in a way.  
I would say that **the story** is not the selling point of the game. It starts pretty strong, like mysteries tend to do, but it misses the grand finale, and is not executed well overall. For example, you can make a point that the "bad" ending would have happened even if the player didn't appear at all, which is pretty weird. And the good ending doesn't differ much from the bad one, so to speak. The main arc with Sally if also confusing for me, I still try to piece together why did she need Warren at all. Mallory logs were great on the other hand, pretty spooky and until a certain point make you doubt that the whole situation is even real.

##### Character management
The character has a standard list of main stats: health, stamina, energy. There is also core level. And that's pretty much it. You can't interact with any other stats, since they are derived or dependant on your gear (like elemental resistance).  
The interesting thing about the main trio is that you can't level them up. At all. In fact, you can't interact with anything in a permanent way, e.g. increasing your health or improving your stamina regeneration once and for all is impossible. Level 1 character and a level 80 one will have absolutely identical combat performance. But this is before we take a look at **implants**. Implants are the "real" way you level up, since all your core level does is providing the energy to use them (armor also eats up some of the core budget, but not weapons). There are a lot of different implant types, some focusing on survivability, others on combat, and some on utility. Business as usual. What is *unusual* is the fact that your healing consumables are also implants, so they are both taking up your core power and your implant slots. This has a lot of interesting implications; from "I'll shove 8 healing implants in there for the boss fight" to "Why would I sacrifice my combat capabilities if I never get hit anyway" (said no one ever btw). Oh, seeing enemy HP is also implant functionality, you don't get this by default.  
You get 8 implant slots maximum at the start of the game, and will be able to raise this number up to 16 on the first playthrough if you find both rig upgrades. It's possible to get this number much higher with subsequent ones. You will still have to meet core requirements to unlock these slots for use though.  
Now, the customization aspect of implants is great. What I don't like about this system though, is the fact that you are not only gated by level, but also by exploration. This is a weird thing to say, but usually the approach is exactly opposite: you get rewarded for exploration, not punished for not doing it. But since your level is tied so tight to the implants, you can't afford to skip all these nooks and crannies, because a next level healing implant might be just around the corner. Yeah, by the way, implants have levels, and you can't upgrade them, only find better versions. This wasn't a problem for me, since I like exploring the world, and the game nudges you to do it all the time, but for some this might be an issue.  

##### Gameplay and combat
The overall gameplay loop is familiar to anyone who played a souls-like game. Kill enemies, get materials from them, return to starting point, spend materials, progress further. There are some twists on the formula, of course.  
The main currency here is tech scrap. It drops from every enemy, and you lose it upon death. Permanently, unless you run back to the spot where you died and retrieve it without dying again. You can spend it on upgrades for your core, which is how levels are called here, and you will need it for weapon and armor upgrades, as well as for crafting. There are two main distinctions from the souls' system. First of all, you can **bank** your scrap. This is pretty neat. Not being able to store souls somehow was one of my biggest gripes with DS3, since this doesn't really serve any purpose other than frustrating the player. If I have a million souls on me, but don't plan to spend them right now for any arbitrary reason, I have to play extra carefully and basically just avoid unfavourable fights at all costs. I fail to see the fun in this situation. Second change is the **scrap multiplier**, and this is where the risk/reward system starts to shine. You can get a multiplier for killing enemies (seems to only increase for gore kills, but I might be wrong), which will increase the amount of scrap you get via kills. However, it gets reset if you enter the medbay to heal and refill your consumables, i.e. healing charges. The multiplier also can get reset if you don't kill anything in a long period of time, but the window is very generous, I had this happen only once during the game. So, with multiplier you can get two times the scrap you would have normally gotten. This promotes a riskier playstyle where the player is encouraged to take more fights before falling back to heal.  
The secondary currency is **parts**. There are weapon parts (same for all weapons) and armor parts (each armor slot has its own associated parts, like leg parts or body parts). Getting them is tightly tied into the combat system, since you can only obtain a part by severing it from an enemy's body. I will talk more about this later. You will need these to craft and upgrade your gear, with higher levels costing more both in the amount and in *tiers* of parts. There are 4 tiers, with the higher parts dropping from the enemies that you meet later in the game. There is also a fifth tier called nano-parts, but these are very limited, since they don't drop from enemies. Long story short, you will be able to upgrade only one set of armor and one weapon per playthrough. Overall, the upgrades are not crucial, and probably even a bit disappointing. When you level up a weapon, only damage increases, and when you level up armor, only defence rating increases. Any special bonuses that gear has, like "-5% stamina consumption" will not change from Mk.I to Mk.V. This upgrade system makes sure that a player will not be incentivized to grind the first area of the game to later steamroll through the rest. But, there is one system that *might* lead players to this behaviour, and this is...  
**Weapon proficiency.** There are 5 types of weapons: staffs, heavy duty, one-handed, single-rigged, double-rigged. Each category has its own experience bar, and you can level up a category by using weapons from it. So if you are using the same weapon type constantly, you will be getting more and more proficient with it, and, therefore, do more damage. Now you might think: "Wow, this looks pretty bad, why would I ever switch to another weapon type if I am already level 10 in one-handed?" Well, not really. First of all, weapons have varying proficiency scaling, with unique and harder-to-obtain weapons typically having higher scaling, but lower base damage. And even these weapons don't get too out of hand compared to the low scaling ones. Second, as with all experience systems, the earlier proficiency ranks are obtained rather quickly, so even if you switch to a weapon type you haven't used before in the late game, you will get more or less back to where you were damage-wise in a couple dozen kills. As it is, it looks more like a helping hand to players who are having trouble with the game, giving them both a feeling of progression even if they are stuck killing (or dying to) the same enemy over and over again, and a little damage boost that they might need. For the experienced players this system shouldn't matter at all, although the "Proficiency levelled up" popups are still satisfying.  
There is another combat option in the game, and this is your **drone**. This is Surge's form of "magic". I won't write about it much, because unfortunately, it's very barebones. There are only 6 drone types in the game, and you can also use one at a time. Each use costs a lot of energy, and frankly, doesn't do much. The best drone in the game seems to be the kinetic shield one, which allows you to be more aggressive and play for more damage. You also get this one last. The bad part about this is that without any kind of special powers every build in the game feels very much the same. The good part is that the devs acknowledged this and are saying that drones will be more important in The Surge 2.  
In short, the **combat** consists of you trying to rip heads off your foes. It's really that simple! While we are on topic, I have to admit that Deck13 knew full well *what* game they were making. There are a lot of dismemberment animations and they are great. You can even chop up a particular boss, so this is pretty sweet as well. Anyway, back to heads. In combat, you can target different parts of enemies' bodies. The more damage you do to a particular part of the body, the more likely it is to come off when you perform a finishing move. These cost energy and pose an interesting dilemma: use a heavy hitting weapon and risk killing the enemy too quickly, or use a lighter weapon to generate enough energy for a finisher. Different weapons have varying energy generation stats, so some even may want to use a specific "farming" weapon. Severing enemy limbs can give you blueprints for weapons/armor they are using, and parts. On the defensive side, you can dodge in different directions (no rolling though, so much less iframes), block, and duck/jump over attacks. Overall, the fights are very fluid and don't feel like backstab fishing fests. Backstabs are in the game, by the way, although they don't do that much for you, and are generally hard to pull off.  
There is one very big problem with the combat for me, however. And this problem is the amount of damage the enemies do. Yes, the game is punishing, is definitely not a cakewalk, but oneshots feel really cheap and frustrating. If you are not good at the game, the starting 100 HP will not get you far, since enemies will start doing much more than that with singular attacks pretty quickly, and even faster than that with combos. In fact, there is such an enemy in the very first area, but this is an optional one and it is placed there as a challenge, so I'll let this slide. But then everyone else starts to do this, and you will be sad for the rest of the game if you, like me, planned to forgo the health implants.  
Speaking of problems, there is another minor one: there is a certain lategame enemy which cannot be killed. Not with weapons, at least. To deal with these, you will have to lower their hp to zero, and then run up to them and hold a button, otherwise they will regen a small portion of health and continue fighting. This *could* be fine, but coupled with the fact that they have the aforementioned one-shot attacks, and the that sometimes the prompt *doesn't appear at all*, or appears too late, it left a sour taste in my mouth.

##### Maps and environments
The playing field is divided into 7 levels of varying sizes. The second area you will get to is the biggest one, and will even expand slightly the second time you get there. This is also the only instance of backtracking, you will not be required to visit any other area multiple times. The game is linear, so you will always visit the locations and fight the bosses in the same order.  
The levels themselves are well built and are reasonably vast. Shortcuts and loopbacks are plentiful, although most suffer from "can't open from this side" syndrome. They are actually even more important here than in the souls games, since you there is only one "OPS", which contains a medbay and a gear assembly station, per level. In my memory, there is only one instance of a poorly thought route without any shortcuts for a long time.  
The environments are not very diverse, you are inside a factory, after all, but they don't feel too boring. Unless you find yourself inside a vent. Boy, these are dime a dozen here, and could probably rival the number of those in Deus Ex. There is a crucial difference however - vents here have enemies in them! Sometimes.  
So, the maps themselves are good. But there are a lot of things that are not matching this quality, and these are...  
**Bad traversal between levels.** There are some parts of the level you won't be able to access right away. They are locked behind security doors, and you won't be able to open these until you are almost done with the main quest. Naturally, you will want to back to them later. Unfortunately, the traversal is done very poorly. Maybe I'm spoiled by the bonfire warps in DS3, but it seems illogical to force the player to do so much legwork just to open a couple of doors (1 door in the case of starting area, and it's the furthest to travel to).  
**Unobvious levers.** These are called "overloads" here, by the way. To use them, player has to meet a core level requirement, but the main quest can be finished without upgrading your core at all. The issue I have with them is that they are so damn unobvious. There is absolutely no indication of what you just did by overloading a specific circuit. Most likely you opened a door somewhere, but who knows? Ironically, the only exception to this is the very last overload in the game, where they show you a quick cinematic of what it did.  
**Leaps of faith.** Since the areas are mostly multi-layered, you can, and sometimes are even required to, jump down some beams to get somewhere. Well, turns out this doesn't work so great when there is no obvious indication of the safe spots to land on. Coupled with losing your resources on death, this results in a subpar experience sometimes.

### Summary
All that being said, The Surge is definitely worth its time. The combat is fun and engaging, and that's what matters most in an action game, after all. The shortcomings are apparent, but they are not deal breakers, at least for me. I really hope that they will fix most of them in the sequel though, the game deserves it.
